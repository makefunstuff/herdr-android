 * Autopilot as Shepherdr 3.1 has it (`core/autopilot.js` in its checkout, `docs/parity/autopilot.md`): one setting for
 * every space of a machine, its heartbeat, schedule and events (Settings › Autopilot, Everywhere's page), and each space's
 * own switch in its Assistant's header. herdr-task keeps it on the machine; the app reads it from the snapshot
 * ([V2Place.pilot], the Autopilot settings page) and sets it as the web does ([V2Actions.autopilot],
 * [V2Actions.autopilotSetting]). The words are 3.1's own.
