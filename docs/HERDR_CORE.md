# herdr-core as a backend

The Herdr desktop app (`herdr-app`) runs its terminals and agents in **herdr-core** (`hc`), not in the classic `herdr server` the app has always talked to. A machine may run either or both. This note says how the app reaches herdr-core and how hc's model maps onto the app's screens. The code is in `core/src/main/kotlin/.../core/hc/`.

Built against `hc` 0.1.14 (`hc schema`: OpenRPC, protocol generation 1). Its answers, as a real `hc connect` gave them, are the test fixtures in `core/src/test/resources/hc/` (paths and names scrubbed).

## Reaching it

- **Detection** (`HcDetection`), per machine, after the SSH login and beside classic herdr's own: one shell probe finds the default session's socket the way hc does (`HC_SOCKET`, else what the running core wrote in `core.lock` in its state folder, else the runtime folder), and only when it exists checks that the session's core runs: on Linux the process holding the lock on `core.lock` (read from `/proc/locks`, without taking it), elsewhere any `herdr-core serve` (`pgrep`; the socket alone where there is no `pgrep`) and lists the `herdr-core` executables (a running core's own installed build first, then `~/.local/bin`, `PATH`, the usual install places, the login shell's `PATH` only when nothing else had one). An `hc` on its own isn't taken for it: herbstluftwm ships one too.
- **Only a running core counts.** `hc connect` starts a core when none listens on its socket, and the app mustn't start a runtime on a machine whose owner doesn't use it. So `connect` is pinned to the socket found (`HC_SOCKET`) and refuses when it's gone. Left: a core that stops in the moment between the probe and `connect` gets a new core, as does, off Linux, a crashed core's socket while another session's core runs. A core found missing is looked for again every minute (the desktop app started later), one that went (a restart, an hc update) after 3 s; with no socket that is one `test` and nothing more.
- **Transport** (`HcConnection`): one `<herdr-core> connect` exec channel per machine on the existing sshj connection, kept for the connection's life and closed with it. `hello {generation: 1, framed: true}` as one JSON line, then framed mode: `[channel u32 LE][kind u8][len u32 LE][payload]`. Channel 0 carries JSON-RPC calls side by side; the event subscription and each attached terminal get a channel of their own, credited back as the app reads, so the one channel carries everything.
- **Client** (`HcClient`): `list`, `get`, `read`, `send`, `keys`, `interrupt`, `subscribe` (snapshot, then events) and `attach` (raw terminal bytes, keys, resize). Errors come back as `HcException` with hc's stable `kind` (`not_found`, `blocked`, …).
- **In the app** (`HostSession`): a machine running both shows both. `HostState.herdrCore` holds herdr-core's version, the core's name and its terminals as a `SessionSnapshot`, next to classic herdr's `HostState.snapshot`, which doesn't change; `awaitHerdrCore()` gives the client. herdr-core is followed outside the classic session's own scope, so a herdr-core failure or hang never fails or holds up the classic session.
- **herdr-core alone**: where classic herdr is missing (not installed, its session not there or not running) but herdr-core runs, the session stays connected for herdr-core and is **online** while herdr-core answers; `HostState.classicMissing` says what classic herdr lacks (`HostState.classic` is false), and the status says it again while herdr-core is gone too. Classic herdr is looked for again every two minutes, as that status's retry would, and at once on Retry; once it answers, the session starts over with both. A dropped SSH link ends the session as usual (checked every 5 s).

## The model

hc itself has terminals only. The desktop app adds its spaces and tabs as labels on each terminal it shows: `herdr.space` and `herdr.tab` (ids) and `where` (`<space> / <tab>`, the names, which `hc ls` prints). That is from herdr-app's source (`src/window.rs`, `write_where` and its `terminal.label` calls); the desktop app isn't installed on the machine the fixtures come from, so their terminals were started with `hc run` and labelled the same way by hand, and their statuses are real 7501 reports (Claude Code's own for one, `printf` for the others). `HcMapping.snapshot` turns live terminals into the app's own `SessionSnapshot`, so the screens read herdr-core as they read classic herdr. Every id starts with `hc:` so both can sit side by side.

| herdr-core | The app | How |
| --- | --- | --- |
| A space (`herdr.space`, name from `where`) | Workspace | `hc:<space>`; numbered in the order its first terminal started |
| A tab (`herdr.tab`, name from `where`) | Tab | `hc:<space>/<tab>` |
| A terminal (`t7`, `rohan/t7` on a machine hc added) | Pane | `hc:t7`; `HcMapping.address` gives `t7` back for hc's calls |
| A helper an agent started (`parent`) | Pane in its parent's tab | as the desktop app places it |
| A terminal the app doesn't show (`hc run`) | Pane in **Other terminals** | one workspace per machine, after the spaces |
| A program that reports a status (OSC 7501), or a known agent before it reports | Agent | `agent` from 7501's `app` (`claude-code` → `claude`), else the program's name; a shell whose agent quit is a terminal again |
| Status `idle` `working` `done` `blocked` | Same status | the program's own word, nothing guessed from the screen |
| Status `error` | Blocked, labelled "error" | it needs the human too |
| `blocked` with `kind` question or auth | Blocked, labelled "question" or "needs sign-in" | permission keeps the plain label |
| 7501 `msg` (else `title`) | The agent's subtitle | "Showing current date and time" |
| Terminal title | `terminalTitle` | Claude Code's "Greeting reply" |
| `status_ms` (when the word changed) | `stateChangeSeq` | snoozes, alerts, notice ids; on a `status` event it's read with `terminal.get`, so it is the core's clock and the same after a resubscribe (the phone's only when that read fails or the word already moved on) |
| `turn` (up each time it leaves working) | `completionSeq` | which finish was seen |
| `foreground.cwd`, else `cwd` | Agent `cwd` | |

What follows on the screens:

- **Agents and Needs you**: hc's agents appear with the classic ones (`HomeAgent` reads `SessionSnapshot`). A blocked one can be answered with its keys (`terminal.keys`: `y`, `enter`, `esc`). `terminal.send` refuses a blocked program (kind `blocked`) unless forced.
- **Notifications**: the app derives them from the status changes it follows (`Notices.between` on two snapshots), so herdr-core's snapshots raise the same notices for working → done and → blocked; the events stream keeps them live.
- **Terminals**: `HcTerminalStream` and classic herdr's `TerminalStream` are both a `LiveTerminal` (emulator, revision, status, send, resize, scroll, close), so the Terminal screen takes either. It is fed by `terminal.attach`; hc sends the program's raw bytes, so the app's own emulator draws them. Attaching takes the terminal's size at once (hc: the last active viewer sets it), as classic herdr's takeover does; a watch-only attach (`observe`) never types or resizes the person's window. When the desktop window takes the size back (someone typed there), hc's `size` event says so; HA-6 passes it to `programResized` so the emulator follows.
- **Chats**: hc reports no transcript, so an hc agent's chat shows its screen (`terminal.read`), as a classic agent without a session does. Following Claude Code's transcript from the agent's `cwd` is a follow-up.

## No match

- **Layouts**: hc has no splits, zoom or focus; each tab's panes are a list. The desktop app keeps its layout to itself.
- **Workspace metadata and worktrees**: hc has no `workspace.report_metadata` tokens (branch, PR) and no `worktree.*`.
- **Plugins, integrations, agent manifests, config reload**: herdr's; hc has templates (`templates.list`) instead.
- **Scrolling back**: hc has no scroll request and the app's emulator keeps no scrollback (classic herdr scrolls on the host), so `scroll` does nothing yet; `terminal.read` has the history as text.
- **SSH sessions**: the one `hc connect` holds an SSH session for the connection's life, beside classic herdr's (OpenSSH allows 10 by default).
- **Ordering against classic agents**: `stateChangeSeq` is an epoch time here and a counter in classic herdr; sorting one machine's agents works, mixing both needs a common key (HA-6).
- **Creating workspaces and tabs**: spaces and tabs are the desktop app's (`herdr-app do`, a GUI control socket); hc can start a terminal (`terminal.run`) and label it into a space.
- **Agent sessions** (`agent_session`): no transcript path; see Chats.
- **herdr's "seen"** (done becomes idle once looked at): hc can't tell; `turn` is the closest.

## On the screens

- **One view**: `HostState.view` is classic herdr's snapshot and herdr-core's together (`Sessions.merge`, classic first, herdr-core's spaces numbered after). The Agents list, Needs you, notices, watches, Live Updates, search, the chats, the machine list and the Terminal screen read it; `HostState.snapshot` stays classic herdr's alone, for what only classic herdr has (layouts, worktrees, workspace metadata, quick commands, the brief). When classic herdr stops on a machine running both, the machine stays online for herdr-core and shows only what is live; classic herdr's last snapshot is kept aside, and its agents' pins, snoozes and watches wait for it (`HostState.agentsKnown`).
- **Keys and words**: `HostSession.awaitAgent(paneId)` gives an `AgentPort`: herdr-core's (`HcAgentPort`) for a pane id with `hc:`, else classic herdr's. `AgentInput` (the chat, the Needs you card's Yes and No, a notification's buttons, Stop on a Live Update) speaks only to it, so an answer is read off the screen again and pressed the same way on either.
- **Chat**: no transcript, so the chat is the agent's screen (`terminal.read`); a question on it gets its card and buttons as a classic agent's does. Classic herdr's own actions (rename, focus, why this state, activity, quick commands) are left out for herdr-core's agents.
- **Terminal**: `HcTerminalStream`; the desktop window taking the size back (`size` event, `HerdrCoreState.sizes`) resizes the phone's emulator. Find, selection by herdr, links, resizing panes and the layout are classic herdr's; selected text is read off the phone's own screen instead.
- **Machine screen**: classic herdr's workspaces, then a **Desktop app** section with herdr-core's spaces, tabs and terminals (no actions on them). The machine list shows herdr-core's version and its agents in the counts.
- **Notifications**: herdr-core's snapshots raise the session's notices as classic herdr's do (none on the first look). While the app is closed, herdr-push (version 9) reads the default core's agents on its socket (plain JSON-RPC, `terminal.list` and `terminal.read`; connecting never starts a core) and pushes them with the classic ones; the app's own look reads them as far as herdr-core was found.
- **Which machine**: herdr-core belongs to the host, not a herdr session, so the app follows it for the default session only, as herdr-push does: two machines in the app for two sessions of one host show its agents once.
- **Order**: classic herdr's `stateChangeSeq` is a counter, herdr-core's the time in ms, so on the Agents list a herdr-core agent sorts before classic ones of the same state.
